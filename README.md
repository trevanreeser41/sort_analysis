# Assignment: Sort Analytics

Copy your sorting functions from last project (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort) into the sorters.py file.

> The functions in `sorters.py` currently use the native Python sorting algorithm. Replace these with your algorithms. Except for the native sort function, don't use the Python sort.

Add one additional sort algorithm: quicksort. The quicksort algorithm is the meat of this assignment.

`main.py` is fully written and doesn't need any modifications. It will test the sort algorithms for different types of lists.

> If the lists take too long (or short) to sort, adjust the number of times they run in the `SOURCE_FILES` constant.
